    </p>
   

<p> Drake Maye was the 3rd overall draft selection of the New England Patriots. Maye was the 3rd quarterback taken in the draft behind Caleb Williams of the USC Trojans and Jayen Daniels of the LSU tigers. Maye was not the only selection of the patriots. The patriots also took wide reciever Ja'Lynn Polk from the University of Washington to support their rookie quarterback. The talented receiver looks to help bolster the Patriots receiving core offering support for their rookie quarterback. Maye is not the only person in the New England organization who is being thrust into a new role as Jerod Mayo is in his first year as head coach of the organization. Mayo, who formerly played linebacker for the Patriots, is taking the reigns from coach Bill Bellichick. Bellichick is a legendary coach, winning 6 supoerbowls in New England alone leaving large shoes to fill for coach Mayo. Maye also has large shoes to fill as Patriots fans have been longing for an elite starting quarterback since the departure of the legendary Tom Brady.  </p>

<p> Maye signed a 4 year fully guaranteed  contract worth 36.64 million dollars shortly after being drafted by the patriots. Maye chose to wear jersey number 10, the same number the patriots prior quarterback, Mac Jones, chose to wear. Maye impressed in training camp with long throws downfield as well as his elusiveness in the pocket and in the running game. Maye followed it up with a strong preseason where he showed that he could play at the NFL level. The Patriots also played quarterbacks Bailey Zappe, Jacoby Brisset and fellow rookie Joe Milton III (University of Tennesse) leaving no shortage of competition for the young quarterback. Maye handled himself well and was named the backup to start the season behind Jacoby Brisset. This decision was met with some criticism as fans wanted to see the rookie out there as soon as possible. Some believed the decision was made to protect the young quarterback as the Patriots have one of the weakest offensive lines in the NFL. Maye was named the starter week 6 and has imnpressed ever since.  </p>

<p> In Maye's first start against the Houston Texans he completed 20 of 33 passes for 243 yards with 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions in the 41-21 loss. He also lead the team with 38 rush yards, which was neccessary as the team was missing their leading rusher Rhamondre Stevenson. Maye's 3 touchdown passes were more than Jacoby Brisset had thrown in his previous 5 starts for the Pats. This made Maye the first quarterback since 1950 to throw 3 touchdown passes and lead his team in rushingn yards in his first start. Maye has continued to break records for rookie quarterbacks proving that he was worth the first round draft pick the patriots spent on him. Maye has continued to impress as a starter with some close loses and impressive wins. Most notably he beat the Chicago Bears and the number 1 overall pick Caleb Williams in decisive fashion. Maye has seen some adversity in his young career as he suffered a concussion in a week 8 win against the Jets, but he would start the next game.  </p>
