<h2>
    <em>Draft</em>
</h2>

<p> Drake Maye was the 3rd overall draft selection of the New England Patriots. Maye was the 3rd quarterback taken in the draft behind Caleb Williams of the USC Trojans and Jayen Daniels of the LSU tigers. Maye was not the only selection of the patriots. The patriots also took wide reciever Ja'Lynn Polk from the University of Washington to support their rookie quarterback. The talented receiver looks to help bolster the Patriots receiving core offering support for their rookie quarterback. Maye is not the only person in the New England organization who is being thrust into a new role as Jerod Mayo is in his first year as head coach of the organization. Mayo, who formerly played linebacker for the Patriots, is taking the reigns from coach Bill Bellichick. Bellichick is a legendary coach, winning 6 supoerbowls in New England alone leaving large shoes to fill for coach Mayo. Maye also has large shoes to fill as Patriots fans have been longing for an elite starting quarterback since the departure of the legendary Tom Brady.  </p>
